# Robot-js

This repository uses [Robot.js](https://robotjs.io/) to automate mouse and keyboard inputs (Node.js is used as a run-time).

- `npm install` to install the required packages
- `npm start` will run the script in `index.js`

**Note:** you may have to update system preferences to allow the script to run.
